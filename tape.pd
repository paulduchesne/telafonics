#X text 100 130 Tape takes three things \, an on/off record toggle
\, a tape loop length and an audio input.;
#X text 100 180 The most complex part here is taking a continuous shared
counter \, wrapping it to a single loop \, and resizing the output
signal so it constantly runs a record/playback head at signal rate.
;
#X text 100 260 test you can rig up - hardcode the loop length to 7000ms
\, and then created something which loops the incoming shared signal
to this length while also sending properly scaled audio signal to playback
a sample.;
